{"name":"Games","tagline":"Personal game development projects.","body":"### What is this?\r\nI thought I could just start off with a small description of this repisotry, in case anyone actually visits this page. The purpose of this repository is to publish my smaller game projects online just so people could play them and send me feedback. I will create everything from original strategy, top-down RPG, side scrolling platformer to prototypes of popular 2D games. If I ever created something big, I will make a new repository just for that game.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
